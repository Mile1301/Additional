Initializing the Productivity App

###

The initial html, css and js files are written where:

1. In the `index.html` file we have
   -horizontal nav with place for logo (now it just says Productivity app) and a button that has a drop down menu with items including logout
   -sidebar with clickable features that when clicked render different html code according to the business logic given from the requirements
   -main content where the different HTML code from the clicked sidebar fetures is rendered
   -footer element
   -for accessibility we can add header, main, aside,etc
2. In the `style.css` file there is some basic css styles needed for the page to work properly
3. In the `app.js` there are the variables needed to be edited with proper HTML code in order to achieve the business logic from the requirements.
   -in this file only the team members assigned for creating the html may post edits in their spaces
   -just to be more clear, it has comments in the file also
4. Next step we have to come up with the ideas how the single features will be created (logic, style, enforcement)

I will deploy it officially on our github repo as soon as I read the docs how it should be done.

For now it is on my github
