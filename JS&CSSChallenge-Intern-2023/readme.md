## About the solution

- All features work but it has two issues
  - When clicked All filters it doubles the render results on the first page, then it works good
  - Few cards with larger pictures look not that ok :)
- The Logic for the number of columns - i found it on internet - i don't know this syntax (you will see also a comment in the CSS and JS file about this)
- Also i don't know how to access the fill property on the SVG file (i searched online but couldn't manage to find suitable solution) so i made a copy od the 'heart.svg' where i changed the the `fill` property from `none` to `blue` in order to set the latter icon on spot when like is clicked. The icon copy file is also in the icons folder named as 'heart-clicked.svg'
- Anyway, this was a good challenge and I enjoyed making it
