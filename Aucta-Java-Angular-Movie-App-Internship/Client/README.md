# MoviesApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.7.

## Scope

Simple movie rating and review platform similar to IMDb or Rotten Tomatoes

## Functionalities

This system will support listing movies, viewing individual movie details, and searching or filtering movies based on various criteria.

## Auth

Since registration and authentication are not needed, users will rate movies anonymously, with ratings ranging from 1 to 10.
I made the front end auth only, but disabled the guards and didn't load the auth feature module at all.

## Database

MongoDb is used as database system.

## Backend

Java Spring Boot is used as a backend framework for creating the API.

## Testing

The front end code is not tested, but the backend has Postman logs for each endpoint.
